# DumbDrop

A stupid simple file upload application that provides a clean, modern interface for dragging and dropping files. Built with Node.js and vanilla JavaScript.

![DumbDrop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b909d26-9ead-4dc7-85bc-8bfda0d366c1)

No auth (unless you want it now!), no storage, no nothing. Just a simple file uploader to drop dumb files into a dumb folder.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (For Dummies)

```bash
# Pull and run with one command
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./uploads:/app/uploads dumbwareio/dumbdrop:latest
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a File - It'll show up in ./uploads
3. Celebrate on how dumb easy this was

### Option 2: Docker Compose (For Dummies who like customizing)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  dumbdrop:
    image: dumbwareio/dumbdrop:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      # Where your uploaded files will land
      - ./uploads:/app/uploads
    environment:
      # Explicitly set upload directory inside the container
      UPLOAD_DIR: /app/uploads
      # The title shown in the web interface
      DUMBDROP_TITLE: DumbDrop
      # Maximum file size in MB
      MAX_FILE_SIZE: 1024
      # Optional PIN protection (leave empty to disable)
      DUMBDROP_PIN: 123456
      # Upload without clicking button
      AUTO_UPLOAD: false
      # The base URL for the application
      # You must update this to the url you use to access your site
      BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a File - It'll show up in ./uploads
3. Rejoice in the glory of your dumb uploads

> **Note:** The `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable is now explicitly set to `/app/uploads` in the container. The Dockerfile only creates the `uploads` directory, not `local_uploads`. The host directory `./uploads` is mounted to `/app/uploads` for persistent storage.

| ALLOWED_ORIGINS                                          | You can restrict CORS to your BASE_URL or a comma-separated list of specified origins, which will automatically include your base_url | '\*'                                                          | No       |

| LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR                                         | Directory for uploads (local dev, fallback: './local_uploads')                                                                        | ./local_uploads                                               | No       |

- **UPLOAD_DIR** is used in Docker/production. If not set, LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR is used for local development. If neither is set, the default is `./local_uploads`.
- **Docker Note:** The Dockerfile now only creates the `uploads` directory inside the container. The host's `./local_uploads` is mounted to `/app/uploads` and should be managed on the host system.
- **BASE_URL**: If you are deploying DumbDrop under a subpath (e.g., `https://example.com/watchfolder/`), you **must** set `BASE_URL` to the full path including the trailing slash (e.g., `https://example.com/watchfolder/`). All API and asset requests will be prefixed with this value. If you deploy at the root, use `https://example.com/`.
- **BASE_URL** must end with a trailing slash. The app will fail to start if this is not the case.

See `.env.example` for a template and more details.

<details>
<summary>ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS (DEPRECATED: see ALLOWED_ORIGINS)</summary>

- This is now deprecated but still works for backwards compatibility
- ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS will be used as a fallback if ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set
- Please update to ALLOWED_ORIGINS for future compatibility

~~To allow this app to be embedded in an iframe on specific origins (such as Organizr), set the `ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS` environment variable. For example:~~

```env
ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS=https://organizr.example.com,https://myportal.com
```

- ~~If not set, the app will only allow itself to be embedded in an iframe on the same origin (default security).~~
- ~~If set, the app will allow embedding in iframes on the specified origins and itself.~~
- ~~**Security Note:** Only add trusted origins. Allowing arbitrary origins can expose your app to clickjacking and other attacks.~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>ALLOWED_ORIGINS</summary>

By default `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set to '\*'

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://organizr.example.com,https://myportal.com,http://internalip:port
```

- If you would like to restrict CORS to your BASE_URL, you can set it like this: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000`
- If you would like to allow multiple origins, you can set it like this: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://internalip:port,https://subdomain.domain.tld`
  - This will automatically include your BASE_URL in the list of allowed origins.
  </details>

<details>
<summary>File Extension Filtering</summary>

To restrict which file types can be uploaded, set the `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` environment variable. For example:

```env
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt
```

If not set, all file extensions will be allowed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Notification Setup</summary>

#### Message Templates

The notification message supports the following placeholders:

- `{filename}`: Name of the uploaded file
- `{size}`: Size of the file (formatted according to APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT)
- `{storage}`: Total size of all files in upload directory

Example message template:

```env
APPRISE_MESSAGE: New file uploaded {filename} ({size}), Storage used {storage}
```

Size formatting examples:

- Auto (default): Chooses nearest unit (e.g., "1.44MB", "256KB")
- Fixed unit: Set APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT to B, KB, MB, GB, or TB

Both {size} and {storage} use the same formatting rules based on APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT.

#### Notification Support

- Integration with [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-notifications) for flexible notifications
- Support for all Apprise notification services
- Customizable notification messages with filename templating
- Optional - disabled if no APPRISE_URL is set
